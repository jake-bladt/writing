Mining the Fields of Flesh

There's a gold rush in the fields of flesh - the name given to the ancient, slowly rotting corpse of a Great Beast that attacked the world and was slain by its greatest heroes.

The Flesh Fields are the back of a truly massive sting-ray shaped beast that tried to destroy the world in ages past. It was slain through the efforts of a consortium of great heroes, but its corpse is miles wide and and a thousand feet deep.
The Great Beast's epidermis is a hundred feet thick and nearly impossible to dig through. It only softens over the course of centuries and patches of it enter a harvestable state for only a few weeks before they turn necrotic and foul. Great Beast flesh is used in many magical concoctions and highly valuable if it hasn't turned. If you don't preserve it before it turns, you don't want to be around when it goes funny.
Even more valuable than the epidermis is the flesh from underneath. Tribes of Dwarves have made their fortune roaming the Flesh Fields, seeking points where the hide has softened, and strip mining straight down to harvest as much as they can while the meat is still good. The lucky ones pull out leaving dangerous undermining that threatens those harvesting the surface. The unlucky ones are... changed.
The necrotic areas are swampy, foul and full of abominations - shamblers, mouthers, feral flesh golems, and the worse things that feed on them.
