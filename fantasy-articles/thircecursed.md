# The Thrice-Cursed World

The Thrice-Cursed World is a fantasy setting designed to be used with Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 or Pathfinder rules. In the TCW, you play the role of a human living on the edge of a large and powerful empire ruled by the lizardman emperor Ssilith IV. The community you were born into straddles the edge of the Great Black Bog. Your parents were once slaves in the lizardman empire, but escaped en masse during a slave revolt twenty years ago. You grew up with the awareness that the empire could come to collect you and your parents or just slaughter you all as a warning to others.

As the children of slaves, you do not know how to read or write, nor are there any books to be found in your community. Your days are filled with work - hunting and fishing if you live in the swamp, farming if you live on the narrow strip of flat land between the swamp and the western forest, mining and trading if you live in the village. As adolescents, you spend about half of each day in training - how to fight, how to hide in the swamp, the words to say to the dwarves of Duro Ghen to get them to offer you sanctuary if the lizardmen come. But your adolescence is drawing to a close. Tonight, you will face the ritual of becoming and the Shaman William Brewer will tell you what tasks are required of you to prove that you are ready for adulthood.
