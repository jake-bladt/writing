As soon as the door closed, Bo headed for the stairs heading into the main part of the house. He paused when Nick cleared his throat.

NOTE: Bo is Chinese. His full name is Bohai.

"So, what do we do next?" Nick asked.

"You mean in-game or for real?" Scott dug into his book bag. "I was going to change into my sweats."

"I meant in general." Nick looked up from the binder in front of him. "After finals and graduation. My plans are kind of blown up for the summer."

No one spoke right away. Everyone was watching him. When Arwen realized no one was going to speak up, she asked, "What do you have in mind?"
