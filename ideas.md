## D&D Trope Breaker Unnamed 1

A young woman is getting married and pleased that her pregnancy isn't showing. She and her fiance are in love and the families are happy. In the midst of the ceremony, she realizes her power as a necromancer, inadvertently raises a graveyard full of zombies and, when the townsfolk attack her for it, the zombies kill them. The bride and groom flee.

A party of adventurers is hired by a cleric of the church where the masssacre took place. They investigate and head off, posse comitatus style after the couple. The party themselves are barely capable of working together already and working with the priest as well is pushing them to the breaking point.

Nobody in the pursuing party knows the bride is the necromancer.

One of the party is a priest of a disparate god.

The ranger wonders: What kind of necromancer leaves behind a church full of perfectly-good corpses?

The party tracks the pair through the woods to where they are seeking shelter with the groom's cousin. A battle ensues. The cousin is killed.

Both parties fight their way to the ruins through orcish tribal lands. The bride acquires more zombies. To counterbalance the zombies, the ranger hires a company of orcs.

Inside the spider-filled ruins, the bride finds a grimoire and starts reading, knowing they're still after her.

The climactic battle comes. Orcs and zombies fight. The bride and groom escape. The priest loses his shit. The ranger frags him.
