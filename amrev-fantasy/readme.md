# AmRev Fantasy

Premise - a fantasy novel based on the American revolution.

## Overview

Seventy years after a cataclysm that nearly wiped out humanity and goblinized most of the world, the nation Thalassa exerts control over most human settlements. On the island of Iona, citizens are chafing under Thalassan rule. When Thalassa overextends itself in an attempt to regain the Sunstone from Khul, Iona takes the opportunity to revolt.

## Major players and motivations

**The Camberleigh Family** - Rulers of Thalassa since the reconquest of that island in 9 PD. The first Camberleigh of note led the defense of the Ring Cities in the opening years of the Goblin Wars.

**The Cullen Family** - Descended from the Liberator of Iona, the Cullens have built a great trading house under Thalassan rule, but chafe under the limitations of the long, long war.

**The Sons of Liberty** - An anti-war, anti-imperialism group that wants Iona out of the war and out of the draft. They have been accumulating martyrs and political prisoners for a while now.

**The Cenwulf Protectorate**

**Dragons of the Claw**

**The Calderans** - Playing both sides

**The Daamgard Family** - a trading family from the Cap. They value Ionan independence because a fractured empire is a customer they can negotiate with more fairly.

**Other Cap Families** - Schou, Overgaard, Lind, Toft, Clausen

**Khul** - and the Sunspire gang

**Hylvyzaj** - an island that was once a high mountain pass between the northern and southern parts of the Vestari empire.

**The Elves** - veterans of the war against the Ravening Dark, stranded on Tierra since the Cataclysm.
