The Stone family's origins are not well-known. They encourage the mystery of it. Even most Stones don't know the truth of it.

The truth:

The first members of the "Stone Family" were prisoners tranported from England in the 1720s. They mutinied on the transport ship, took it over, and landed on Stone Island off the coast of Maine(?)
