The Stone family's origins are not well-known. They encourage the mystery of it. Even most Stones don't know the truth of it.

The truth:

The first members of the "Stone Family" were prisoners tranported from England in the 1720s. They mutinied on the transport ship, took it over, and landed on Stone Island off the coast of Maine(?). The island was previously believed to be dry, but squatters had discovered a hidden spring.

The original settlers changed their names and all became "Stone." To stay hidden, they pretended to be a cult and eventually attracted true believers.

During the Revolutionary War, the family split over the question of independence with a small spur of the family tree eventually serving in the British Army and going back to Britain after the war.

Jeb Stone I - widely viewed as the family patriarch, headed for San Francisco in the 1840s, made a fortune supplying miners, moved to LA in the 1850s, supplied the Union with much-needed goods during the Civil War. He bought up large amounts of LA real estate.

Jeb, Jr. was a major backer of William Mulholland and the plan to bring water to LA.
