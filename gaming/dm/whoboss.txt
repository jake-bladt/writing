One question a lot of worldbuidlers never seem to ask is, "Why are the people at the top of my society in charge?"

If an emperor can't deal with a group of mid-level murderhoboes, why is he the emperor?

Why do people follow leaders?

* Protection
* Oppression
* Tradition

If you image a weak king, imagine who would kill him and take over. If that still results in a weak king, repeat the process.

Not all societies are stable. Possible plot hooks based around unstable societies.
