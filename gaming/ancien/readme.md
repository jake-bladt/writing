# The World of Ancien (aka The World)

Ancien is a world behind the demon lines in the War of the Outer Dark. Because sidhe can't reach it, demons hold only a relatively small beachhead here, based around a single city from which they claim to own the world.

The idea of this world as a campaign is to play short clusters of sessions in each time frame before leaping ahead years or decades to the next time frame. Instead of playing individual characters, players sometimes play bloodlines - strings of characters who descend from each other (or each other's extended families) and tend to inherit their gear and (as a game mechanic) their XP, level, etc.
