# Demonlands

## Premise

An ancient world where humanity has all but wiped themselves, dwarves, and elves out. Orcs are the dominant race through most of the world. The majority of "men" were raised by the gods from beasts. These beast-men are frequently called "demons" by the First Men, the orcs, and each other.

## History

Based loosely on the world in the Thalassan Sphere in which humans have lost to orcs post-Cataclysm. For centuries, only the Dragonborn could stand up to the orcs. Because of their chaotic nature, the orcs turned on each other and lost cohesion in the empire known as Kaza Orok and are now largely confined to a single, massive island in the north.

About three hundred years ago, the gods returned to Yterra
