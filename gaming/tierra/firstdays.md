# The First Days

A campaign set in the earliest days of recorded history, before and during the sidhe incursion.

## As a campaign

Starting premise: three short adventures, one as swamp people, one as lake people, one as dwarves. They all revolve around the discovery of the sidhe gate. After those three, the players can each choose one of their three characters to play going forward.
