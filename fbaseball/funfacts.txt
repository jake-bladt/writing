Jake's Fantasy Draft Fun Facts:

1. I drafted five teams this year - four in public leagues and this one.
2. My most drafted players: Twins second-basemen Brian Dozier, drafted in four leagues and Mets closer Jerys Familia in three leagues. I drafted 19 players in two separate leagues.
3. I didn't draft a single player from the Detroit Tigers or the Chicago White Sox in any of my drafts. #coastalbias
